# Unlimited Daily Saves for Pixlr.com

The original extension on the Chrome Web Store [got DMCA'd by Pixlr](https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/34809232).
Because of that, I've decided to open source it.

A CRX file can be found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/ClaytonTDM/daily-saves-for-pixlr/releases). an XPI will be available soon.
